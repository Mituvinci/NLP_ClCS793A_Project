Repository URL: https://github.com/Siddhi-Nargund/Analysed-precision-of-StringTie-for-long-reads-RNA-Seq-data
Description: Developed scripts assess assembly of StringTie for short-reads and direct long-reads by checking presence of transcripts, extract transcripts from GTF files with transcript classification codes. Aligned transcripts generated by StringTie back to genome and quantify reads for each transcript.
